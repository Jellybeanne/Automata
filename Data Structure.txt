Data structure :

Two classes :
	Automaton : the class that will contain the automaton
		in the automaton we have
		alphabet : an array of char used to store the alphabet of the automaton
		states : an array of Node used to store all the states in the automaton
		isNotDet : a boolean telling that the automaton is not deterministic (set during the loading of the automaton by knowing that there is multiple entries)
		det_table : an array in the same form as states but that has been deterministic
		complete : an array in the same form as states or det_table but that has been completed

	Node : a class representing one state in the automaton
		transitions : an array containing transitions that are in the form [letter, [directions]] with directions being Node objects, and being a list for undeterministic automaton
		isOutput /	isEntry  booleans to know if the state is an Entry or an Exit in the automaton
		name : String storing the name of the state in the form 1.2 in case of fused states
